# Project: Java Code Quality Analyzer

## Project Description

The Java Code Quality Analyzer is a plugin designed to improve the quality of Java code. It provides an interactive tool
window that offers real-time code suggestions. The following are proposed essential features, including rule set
integration, telemetry connectivity, and Azure Toolkit integration.

## Key Features

- **Rule Set Integration**: This feature enables users to import and customize rule sets, tailoring the plugin to their
  specific needs.
- **Telemetry Integration**: This feature connects the plugin to the backend with Application Insights, allowing for
  efficient data transmission.
- **Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ Integration**: This feature allows the plugin to integrate with the Azure Toolkit for
  IntelliJ, providing extended functionality
- **Editor Integration**: This feature offers continuous analysis and real-time code suggestions, enhancing the coding
  experience.
- **Quick-Fix Actions**: This feature identifies issues and suggests quick actions within the tool window, facilitating
  immediate problem resolution.

## User Interface

- **Telemetry Configuration Panel** : This space allows users to enable or disable telemetry if desired.

## Rules

1. #### Storage Upload without Length Check

- **Anti-pattern**: Using Azure Storage upload APIs that donâ€™t take a length parameter, causing the entire data payload
  to be buffered into memory before uploading.
- **Issue**: This can lead to OutOfMemoryErrors, especially with large files or high-volume uploads.
- **Severity: INFO**
- **Recommendation**: Use APIs that take a length parameter. Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-upload-java)
  for additional information.

2. #### Use ServiceBusProcessorClient instead of ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.

- **Anti-pattern**: The use of the Reactor receiver, specifically the `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, is an
  anti-pattern. This is because it's a low-level API that provides fine-grained control over message handling. While
  this might seem beneficial, it requires a high level of proficiency in Reactive programming and is mainly useful when
  building a Reactive library or an end-to-end Reactive application.

- **Issue**: The main issue with using `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient` is its complexity and the requirement for a deep
  understanding of Reactive programming. This can make it difficult to use correctly and efficiently, especially for
  developers who are not familiar with Reactive programming paradigms.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of using the low-level `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, it's recommended to use
  the `ServiceBusProcessorClient`. The `ServiceBusProcessorClient` is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies message
  consumption. It's designed for most common use cases and should be the primary choice for consuming messages. This
  makes it a more suitable option for most developers and scenarios.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/servicebus/azure-messaging-servicebus/README.md#when-to-use-servicebusprocessorclient)
  for additional information.

3. #### Disable Auto-complete when using ServiceBusReceiver or Processor clients

- **Anti-pattern**: When using ServiceBusReceiver or Processor clients, auto-complete is enabled by default, but this
  behavior is not explicitly verified or disabled when necessary.
- **Issue**: Auto-complete being enabled by default might lead to messages being marked as completed even if the message
  processing fails or encounters an error.
  Errors in message processing might not be noticed since the message is automatically completed regardless of success
  or failure, making it harder to identify and handle issues.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly Disable Auto-Complete: When creating ServiceBusReceiver or Processor clients,
  explicitly use the
  disableAutoComplete() method call to prevent automatic message completion.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclientbuilder.servicebusreceiverclientbuilder?view=azure-java-stable#com-azure-messaging-servicebus-servicebusclientbuilder-servicebusreceiverclientbuilder-disableautocomplete())
  for additional information.

4. #### Dynamic Client Creation is wasteful

- **Anti-pattern**: Dynamic client creation refers to creating a new client instance for each operation, without reusing
  existing instances.
- **Issue**: This process can be resource-intensive and slow, especially if repeated frequently. It can lead to
  performance issues, increased memory usage, and unnecessary overhead.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of creating a new client instance for each operation, consider reusing existing client
  instances.
  It's recommended to create client instances once and reuse them throughout the application's lifecycle.
  This approach can lead to better performance and efficiency.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/sdk/overview#connect-to-and-use-azure-resources-with-client-libraries)
  for additional information.

5. #### Hardcoded APIs & Access Tokens Check

- **Anti-pattern**: Hardcoding API keys and tokens in the source code.
- **Issue**: The source code contains hardcoded API keys and tokens, which is a security risk. It exposes sensitive
  information that could be exploited if the code is publicly accessible or falls into the wrong hands.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: DefaultAzureCredential is recommended for authentication if the service client supports Token
  Credential (Entra ID Authentication). If not, then use Azure Key Credential for API key based authentication. Please
  refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable)
  for additional information.

6. #### Using Connection Strings to build Azure Service Clients

- **Anti-pattern**: Using Connection Strings for Authenticating Azure SDK Clients.
- **Issue**: Connection strings authentication is not recommended in Azure SDKs for Java due to potential security
  vulnerabilities.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Azure service client authentication is recommended if the service client supports Token
  Credential (Entra ID Authentication). If not, then use Azure Key Credential or Connection Strings based
  authentication. Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable)
  for additional information.

7. #### Kusto Queries Having a Time Interval in the Query String

- **Anti-pattern**: Writing KQL queries with hard-coded time intervals directly in the query string.
- **Issue**: This approach makes queries less flexible and harder to troubleshoot.
- **Recommendation**: Consider using the `QueryTimeInterval` parameter in the client method parameters to specify the
  time interval for the query.
  By passing the time range as an argument in the method call, you make it easier to troubleshoot and understand the
  context of an API call.
  Please refer to
  the [QueryTimeInterval Class documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.monitor.query.models.querytimeinterval?view=azure-java-stable)
  for additional information.
