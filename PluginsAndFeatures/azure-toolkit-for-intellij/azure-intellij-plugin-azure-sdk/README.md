# Project: Java Code Quality Analyzer

## Project Description
The Java Code Quality Analyzer, is a plugin designed to improve the quality of Java code. It provides an interactive tool window that offers real-time code suggestions. The following are proposed essential features, including rule set integration, telemetry connectivity, and Azure Toolkit integration.

## Key Features

- **Rule Set Integration**: This feature enables users to import and customize rule sets, tailoring the plugin to their specific needs.
- **Telemetry Integration**: This feature connects the plugin to the backend with Application Insights, allowing for efficient data transmission.
- **Azure Toolkit Integration**: This feature allows the plugin to integrate with the IntelliJ Azure toolkit, providing extended functionality.
- **Editor Integration**: This feature offers continuous analysis and real-time code suggestions, enhancing the coding experience.
- **Quick-Fix Actions**: This feature identifies issues and suggests quick actions within the tool window, facilitating immediate problem resolution.

## User Interface
- **Telemetry Configuration Panel** : This space allows users to enable or disable telemetry if desired.


## Rules
1. #### Use ServiceBusProcessorClient instead of ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.
- **Anti-pattern**: The use of the Reactor receiver, specifically the `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, is an anti-pattern. This is because it's a low-level API that provides fine-grained control over message handling. While this might seem beneficial, it requires a high level of proficiency in Reactive programming and is mainly useful when building a Reactive library or an end-to-end Reactive application.

- **Issue**: The main issue with using `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient` is its complexity and the requirement for a deep understanding of Reactive programming. This can make it difficult to use correctly and efficiently, especially for developers who are not familiar with Reactive programming paradigms.
- **Severity: INFO**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of using the low-level `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, it's recommended to use the `ServiceBusProcessorClient`. The `ServiceBusProcessorClient` is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies message consumption. It's designed for most common use cases and should be the primary choice for consuming messages. This makes it a more suitable option for most developers and scenarios.

3. #### Dynamic Client Creation is wasteful
- **Anti-pattern**: Dynamic client creation refers to creating a new client instance for each operation, without reusing existing instances.
- **Issue**: This process can be resource-intensive and slow, especially if repeated frequently. It can lead to performance issues, increased memory usage, and unnecessary overhead.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of creating a new client instance for each operation, consider reusing existing client instances. 
It's recommended to create client instances once and reuse them throughout the application's lifecycle. 
This approach can lead to better performance and efficiency.
